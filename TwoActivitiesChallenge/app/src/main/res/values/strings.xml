    <string name="first_message">The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick
    his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from
    one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him
    the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the
    creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a
    witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.
    "Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"
    The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell
    pattering.
    "Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."
    The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the
    jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.
    The voice spoke again.
    "I can\'t hardly move with all these creeper things."
    The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched
    on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by
    thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than
    the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then
    looked up through thick spectacles.
    "Where\'s the man with the megaphone?"
    The fair boy shook his head.
    "This is an island. At least I think it\'s an island. That\'s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps
    there aren\'t any grownups anywhere."
    The fat boy looked startled.
    "There was that pilot. But he wasn\'t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."
    The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.
    "All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They
    must have, mustn\'t they?"
    The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to
    be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.
    "Aren\'t there any grownups at all?"
    "I don\'t think so."
    The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame
    him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.
    "No grownups!"
    The fat boy thought for a moment.
    "That pilot."
    The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth.
    "He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn\'t land here. Not in a place
    with wheels."
    "We was attacked!"
    "He\'ll be back all right."
    The fat boy shook his head.
    "When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows. I saw the other
    part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it."
    He looked up and down the scar.
    "And this is what the cabin done."
    The fair boy reached out and touched the jagged end of a trunk. For a moment he
    looked interested.
    "What happened to it?" he asked. "Where\'s it got to now?"
    "That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn\'t half dangerous with all them tree trunks
    falling. There must have been some kids still in it."
    He hesitated for a moment, then spoke again.
    "What\'s your name?"
    "Ralph."
    The fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this proffer of acquaintance was
    not made; the fair boy called Ralph smiled vaguely, stood up, and began to make his way once
    more toward the lagoon. The fat boy hung steadily at his shoulder.
    "I expect there\'s a lot more of us scattered about. You haven\'t seen any others, have
    you?"
    Ralph shook his head and increased his speed. Then he tripped over a branch and came
    down with a crash.
    The fat boy stood by him, breathing hard.
    "My auntie told me not to run," he explained, "on account of my asthma."
    "Ass-mar?"
    "That\'s right. Can\'t catch my breath. I was the only boy in our school what had
    asthma," said the fat boy with a touch of pride. "And I\'ve been wearing specs since I was
    three."
    He took off his glasses and held them out to Ralph, blinking and smiling, and then
    started to wipe them against his grubby wind-breaker. An expression of pain and inward
    concentration altered the pale contours of his face. He smeared the sweat from his cheeks and
    quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose.
    "Them fruit."
    He glanced round the scar.
    "Them fruit," he said, "I expect "
    He put on his glasses, waded away from Ralph, and crouched down among the tangled
    foliage.
    "I\'ll be out again in just a minute "
    Ralph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the branches. In a few
    seconds the fat boy\'s grunts were behind him and he was hurrying toward the screen that still
    lay between him and the lagoon. He climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle.
    The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the
    light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was
    a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered
    with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper
    and the open space of the scar. Ralph stood, one hand against a grey trunk, and screwed up his
    eyes against the shimmering water. Out there, perhaps a mile away, the white surf flinked on a
    coral reef, and beyond that the open sea was dark blue. Within the irregular arc of coral the
    lagoon was still as a mountain lake blue of all shades and shadowy green and purple. The
    beach between the palm terrace and the water was a thin stick, endless apparently, for to
    Ralph\'s left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew to a point at infinity; and
    always, almost visible, was the heat.
    He jumped down from the terrace. The sand was thick over his black shoes and the
    heat hit him. He became conscious of the weight of clothes, kicked his shoes off fiercely and
    ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement. Then he leapt back on
    the terrace, pulled off his shirt, and stood there among the skull-like coconuts with green
    shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin. He undid the snake-clasp of his
    belt, lugged off his shorts and pants, and stood there naked, looking at the dazzling beach and
    the water.
    He was old enough, twelve years and a few months, to have lost the prominent tummy
    of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward. You could
    see now that he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went, but there
    was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil. He patted the palm trunk
    softly, and, forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and
    stood on his head. He turned neatly on to his feet, jumped down to the beach, knelt and swept
    a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest. Then he sat back and looked at the water
    with bright, excited eyes.
    "Ralph "
    The fat boy lowered himself over the terrace and sat down carefully, using the edge as a
    seat.
    "I\'m sorry I been such a time. Them fruit "
    He wiped his glasses and adjusted them on his button nose. The frame had made a
    deep, pink "V" on the bridge. He looked critically at Ralph\'s golden body and then down at his
    own clothes. He laid a hand on the end of a zipper that extended down his chest.
    "My auntie "
    Then he opened the zipper with decision and pulled the whole wind-breaker over his
    head.
    "There!"
    Ralph looked at him sidelong and said nothing.
    "I expect we\'ll want to know all their names," said the fat boy, "and make a list. We
    ought to have a meeting."
    Ralph did not take the hint so the fat boy was forced to continue.
    "I don\'t care what they call me," he said confidentially, "so long as they don\'t call me
    what they used to call me at school."
    Ralph was faintly interested.
    "What was that?"
    The fat boy glanced over his shoulder, then leaned toward Ralph.
    He whispered.
    "They used to call me \'Piggy.\'"
    Ralph shrieked with laughter. He jumped up.
    "Piggy! Piggy!"
    "Ralph please!"
    Piggy clasped his hands in apprehension.
    "I said I didn\'t want "
    "Piggy! Piggy!"
    Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane,
    with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.
    "Sche-aa-ow!"
    He dived in the sand at Piggy\'s feet and lay there laughing.
    "Piggy!"
    Piggy grinned reluctantly, pleased despite himself at even this much recognition.
    "So long as you don\'t tell the others "
    Ralph giggled into the sand. The expression of pain and concentration returned to
    Piggy\'s face.
    "Half a sec\'."
    He hastened back into the forest. Ralph stood up and trotted along to the right.
    Here the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape; a great
    platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and
    lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high. The top of this was covered with a thin layer of
    soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees. There was not enough soil for them to
    grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried, forming a
    criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit on. The palms that still stood made a green
    roof, covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon. Ralph
    hauled himself onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided
    that the shadows on his body were really green. He picked his way to the seaward edge of the
    platform and stood looking down into the water. It was clear to the bottom and bright with
    the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral. A school of tiny, glittering fish flicked hither and
    thither. Ralph spoke to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight.
    "Whizzoh!"
    Beyond the platform there was more enchantment. Some act of God a typhoon
    perhaps, or the storm that had accompanied his own arrival had banked sand inside the
    lagoon so that there was a long, deep pool in the beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the
    further end. Ralph had been deceived before now by the specious appearance of depth in a
    beach pool and he approached this one preparing to be disappointed. But the island ran true
    to form and the incredible pool, which clearly was only invaded by the sea at high tide, was so
    deep at one end as to be dark green. Ralph inspected the whole thirty yards carefully and then
    plunged in. The water was warmer than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge
    bath.
    Piggy appeared again, sat on the rocky ledge, and watched Ralph\'s green and white
    body enviously.
    "You can\'t half swim."
    "Piggy."
    Piggy took off his shoes and socks, ranged them carefully on the ledge, and tested the
    water with one toe.
    "It\'s hot!"
    "What did you expect?"
    "I didn\'t expect nothing. My auntie "
    "Sucks to your auntie!"
    Ralph did a surface dive and swam under water with his eyes open; the sandy edge of
    the pool loomed up like a hillside. He turned over, holding his nose, and a golden light danced
    and shattered just over his face. Piggy was looking determined and began to take off his shorts.
    Presently he was palely and fatly naked. He tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool, and sat
    there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at Ralph.
    "Aren\'t you going to swim?"
    Piggy shook his head.
    "I can\'t swim. I wasn\'t allowed. My asthma "
    "Sucks to your ass-mar!"
    Piggy bore this with a sort of humble patience. "You can\'t half swim well."
    Ralph paddled backwards down the slope, immersed his mouth and blew a jet of water
    into the air. Then he lifted his chin and spoke.
    "I could swim when I was five. Daddy taught me. He\'s a commander in the Navy.
    When he gets leave he\'ll come and rescue us. What\'s your father?"
    Piggy flushed suddenly.
    "My dad\'s dead," he said quickly, "and my mum "
    He took off his glasses and looked vainly for something with which to clean them.
    "I used to live with my auntie. She kept a candy store. I used to get ever so many
    candies. As many as I liked. When\'ll your dad rescue us?"
    "Soon as he can."
    Piggy rose dripping from the water and stood naked, cleaning his glasses with a sock.
    The only sound that reached them now through the heat of the morning was the long,
    grinding roar of the breakers on the reef.
    "How does he know we\'re here?"
    Ralph lolled in the water. Sleep enveloped him like the swathing mirages that were
    wrestling with the brilliance of the lagoon.
    "How does he know we\'re here?"
    Because, thought Ralph, because, because. The roar from the reef became very distant.
    "They\'d tell him at the airport."
    Piggy shook his head, put on his flashing glasses and looked down at Ralph.
    "Not them. Didn\'t you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They\'re all
    dead."
    Ralph pulled himself out of the water, stood facing Piggy, and considered this unusual
    problem.
    Piggy persisted.
    "This an island, isn\'t it?"
    "I climbed a rock," said Ralph slowly, "and I think this is an island."
    "They\'re all dead," said Piggy, "an\' this is an island. Nobody don\'t know we\'re here.
    Your dad don\'t know, nobody don\'t know "
    His lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist.
    "We may stay here till we die."
    With that word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening weight and the
    lagoon attacked them with a blinding effulgence.
    "Get my clothes," muttered Ralph. "Along there."
    He trotted through the sand, enduring the sun\'s enmity, crossed the platform and
    found his scattered clothes. To put on a grey shirt once more was strangely pleasing. Then he
    climbed the edge of the platform and sat in the green shade on a convenient trunk. Piggy
    hauled himself up, carrying most of his clothes under his arms. Then he sat carefully on a fallen
    trunk near the little cliff that fronted the lagoon; and the tangled reflections quivered over
    him.
    Presently he spoke.
    "We got to find the others. We got to do something."
    Ralph said nothing. Here was a coral island. Protected from the sun, ignoring Piggy\'s
    ill-omened talk, he dreamed pleasantly.
    Piggy insisted.
    "How many of us are there?"
    Ralph came forward and stood by Piggy.
    "I don\'t know."
    Here and there, little breezes crept over the polished waters beneath the haze of heat.
    When these breezes reached the platform the palm fronds would whisper, so that spots of
    blurred sunlight slid over their bodies or moved like bright, winged things in the shade.
    Piggy looked up at Ralph. All the shadows on Ralph\'s face were reversed; green above,
    bright below from the lagoon. A blur of sunlight was crawling across his hair.
    "We got to do something."
    Ralph looked through him. Here at last was the imagined but never fully realized place
    leaping into real life. Ralph\'s lips parted in a delighted smile and Piggy, taking this smile to
    himself as a mark of recognition, laughed with pleasure.
    "If it really is an island "
    "What\'s that?"
    Ralph had stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon. Something creamy lay
    among the ferny weeds.
    "A stone."
    "No. A shell."
    Suddenly Piggy was a-bubble with decorous excitement.
    "S\'right. It\'s a shell! I seen one like that before. On someone\'s back wall. A conch he
    called it. He used to blow it and then his mum would come. It\'s ever so valuable "
    Near to Ralph\'s elbow a palm sapling leaned out over the lagoon. Indeed, the weight
    was already pulling a lump from the poor soil and soon it would fall. He tore out the stem and
    began to poke about in the water, while the brilliant fish flicked away on this side and that.
    Piggy leaned dangerously.
    "Careful! You\'ll break it "
    "Shut up."
    Ralph spoke absently. The shell was interesting and pretty and a worthy plaything; but
    the vivid phantoms of his day-dream still interposed between him and Piggy, who in this
    context was an irrelevance. The palm sapling, bending, pushed the shell across the weeds.
    Ralph used one hand as a fulcrum and pressed down with the other till the shell rose, dripping,
    and Piggy could make a grab.
    Now the shell was no longer a thing seen but not to be touched, Ralph too became
    excited. Piggy babbled:
    " a conch; ever so expensive. I bet if you wanted to buy one, you\'d have to pay pounds
    and pounds and pounds he had it on his garden wall, and my auntie "
    Ralph took the shell from Piggy and a little water ran down his arm. In color the shell
    was deep cream, touched here and there with fading pink. Between the point, worn away into
    a little hole, and the pink lips of the mouth, lay eighteen inches of shell with a slight spiral
    twist and covered with a delicate, embossed pattern. Ralph shook sand out of the deep tube.
    " mooed like a cow," he said. "He had some white stones too, an\' a bird cage with a
    green parrot. He didn\'t blow the white stones, of course, an\' he said "
    Piggy paused for breath and stroked the glistening thing that lay in Ralph\'s hands.
    "Ralph!"
    Ralph looked up.
    "We can use this to call the others. Have a meeting. They\'ll come when they hear us "
    He beamed at Ralph.
    "That was what you meant, didn\'t you? That\'s why you got the conch out of the water?"
    Ralph pushed back his fair hair.
    "How did your friend blow the conch?"
    "He kind of spat," said Piggy. "My auntie wouldn\'t let me blow on account of my
    asthma. He said you blew from down here." Piggy laid a hand on his jutting abdomen. "You
    try, Ralph. You\'ll call the others."
    Doubtfully, Ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew. There
    came a rushing sound from its mouth but nothing more. Ralph wiped the salt water off his lips
    and tried again, but the shell remained silent.
    "He kind of spat."
    Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise.
    This amused both boys so much that Ralph went on squirting for some minutes, between
    bouts of laughter.
    "He blew from down here."
    Ralph grasped the idea and hit the shell with air from his diaphragm. Immediately the
    thing sounded. A deep, harsh note boomed under the palms, spread through the intricacies of
    the forest and echoed back from the pink granite of the mountain. Clouds of birds rose from
    the treetops, and something squealed and ran in the undergrowth.
    Ralph took the shell away from his lips.
    "Gosh!"
    His ordinary voice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the conch. He laid
    the conch against his lips, took a deep breath and blew once more. The note boomed again:
    and then at his firmer pressure, the note, fluking up an octave, became a strident blare more
    penetrating than before. Piggy was shouting something, his face pleased, his glasses flashing.
    The birds cried, small animals scuttered. Ralph\'s breath failed; the note dropped the octave,
    became a low wubber, was a rush of air.
    The conch was silent, a gleaming tusk; Ralph\'s face was dark with breathlessness and
    the air over the island was full of bird-clamor and echoes ringing.
    "I bet you can hear that for miles."
    Ralph found his breath and blew a series of short blasts.
    Piggy exclaimed: "There\'s one!"
    A child had appeared among the palms, about a hundred yards along the beach. He was
    a boy of perhaps six years, sturdy and fair, his clothes torn, his face covered with a sticky mess
    of fruit. His trousers had been lowered for an obvious purpose and had only been pulled back
    half-way. He jumped off the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles;
    he stepped out of them and trotted to the platform. Piggy helped him up. Meanwhile Ralph
    continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest. The small boy squatted in front of Ralph,
    looking up brightly and vertically. As he received the reassurance of something purposeful
    being done he began to look satisfied, and his only clean digit, a pink thumb, slid into his
    mouth.
    Piggy leaned down to him.
    "What\'s yer name?"
    "Johnny."
    Piggy muttered the name to himself and then shouted it to Ralph, who was not
    interested because he was still blowing. His face was dark with the violent pleasure of making
    this stupendous noise, and his heart was making the stretched shirt shake. The shouting in the
    forest was nearer.
    Signs of life were visible now on the beach. The sand, trembling beneath the heat haze,
    concealed many figures in its miles of length; boys were making their way toward the platform
    through the hot, dumb sand. Three small children, no older than Johnny, appeared from
    startlingly close at hand, where they had been gorging fruit in the forest. A dark little boy, not
    much younger than Piggy, parted a tangle of undergrowth, walked on to the platform, and
    smiled cheerfully at everybody. More and more of them came. Taking their cue from the
    innocent Johnny, they sat down on the fallen palm trunks and waited. Ralph continued to
    blow short, penetrating blasts. Piggy moved among the crowd, asking names and frowning to
    remember them. The children gave him the same simple obedience that they had given to the
    men with megaphones. Some were naked and carrying their clothes; others half-naked, or
    more or less dressed, in school uniforms, grey, blue, fawn, jacketed, or jerseyed. There were
    badges, mottoes even, stripes of color in stockings and pullovers. Their heads clustered above
    the trunks in the green shade; heads brown, fair, black, chestnut, sandy, mouse-colored; heads
    muttering, whispering, heads full of eyes that watched Ralph and speculated. Something was
    being done.
    The children who came along the beach, singly or in twos, leapt into visibility when
    they crossed the line from heat haze to nearer sand. Here, the eye was first attracted to a
    black, bat-like creature that danced on the sand, and only later perceived the body above it.
    The bat was the child\'s shadow, shrunk by the vertical sun to a patch between the hurrying
    feet. Even while he blew, Ralph noticed the last pair of bodies that reached the platform above
    a fluttering patch of black. The two boys, bullet-headed and with hair like tow, flung
    themselves down and lay grinning and panting at Ralph like dogs. They were twins, and the
    eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication. They breathed together, they
    grinned together, they were chunky and vital. They raised wet lips at Ralph, for they seemed
    provided with not quite enough skin, so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths
    pulled open. Piggy bent his flashing glasses to them and could be heard between the blasts,
    repeating their names.
    "Sam, Eric, Sam, Eric."
    Then he got muddled; the twins shook their heads and pointed at each other and the
    crowd laughed.
    At last Ralph ceased to blow and sat there, the conch trailing from one hand, his head
    bowed on his knees. As the echoes died away so did the laughter, and there was silence.
    Within the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along. Ralph saw
    it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature
    stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but
    mostly clothing. The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two
    parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing. Shorts, shirts, and different garments
    they carried in their hands; but each boy wore a square black cap with a silver badge on it.
    Their bodies, from throat to ankle, were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross
    on the left breast and each neck was finished off with a hambone frill. The heat of the tropics,
    the descent, the search for food, and now this sweaty march along the blazing beach had given
    them the complexions of newly washed plums. The boy who controlled them was dressed in
    the same way though his cap badge was golden. When his party was about ten yards from the
    platform he shouted an order and they halted, gasping, sweating, swaying in the fierce light.
    The boy himself came forward, vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying, and peered
    into what to him was almost complete darkness.
    "Where\'s the man with the trumpet?"
    Ralph, sensing his sun-blindness, answered him.
    "There\'s no man with a trumpet. Only me."
    The boy came close and peered down at Ralph, screwing up his face as he did so. What
    he saw of the fair-haired boy with the creamy shell on his knees did not seem to satisfy him.
    He turned quickly, his black cloak circling.
    "Isn\'t there a ship, then?"
    Inside the floating cloak he was tall, thin, and bony; and his hair was red beneath the
    black cap. His face was crumpled and freckled, and ugly without silliness. Out of this face
    stared two light blue eyes, frustrated now, and turning, or ready to turn, to anger.
    "Isn\'t there a man here?"
    Ralph spoke to his back.
    "No. We\'re having a meeting. Come and join in."
    The group of cloaked boys began to scatter from close line. The tall boy shouted at
    them.
    "Choir! Stand still!"
    Wearily obedient, the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in the sun. None
    the less, some began to protest faintly.
    "But, Merridew. Please, Merridew . . . can\'t we?"
    Then one of the boys flopped on his face in the sand and the line broke up. They
    heaved the fallen boy to the platform and let him lie. Merridew, his eyes staring, made the best
    of a bad job.
    "All right then. Sit down. Let him alone."
    "But Merridew."
    "He\'s always throwing a faint," said Merridew. "He did in Gib.; and Addis; and at
    matins over the precentor."
    This last piece of shop brought sniggers from the choir, who perched like black birds
    on the criss-cross trunks and examined Ralph with interest. Piggy asked no names. He was
    intimidated by this uniformed superiority and the offhand authority in Merridew\'s voice. He
    shrank to the other side of Ralph and busied himself with his glasses.
    Merridew turned to Ralph.
    "Aren\'t there any grownups?"
    "No."
    Merridew sat down on a trunk and looked round the circle.
    "Then we\'ll have to look after ourselves."
    Secure on the other side of Ralph, Piggy spoke timidly.
    "That\'s why Ralph made a meeting. So as we can decide what to do. We\'ve heard
    names. That\'s Johnny. Those two they\'re twins, Sam \'n Eric. Which is Eric ? You? No
    you\'re Sam "
    "I\'m Sam "
    "\'n I\'m Eric."
    "We\'d better all have names," said Ralph, "so I\'m Ralph."
    "We got most names," said Piggy. "Got \'em just now."
    "Kids\' names," said Merridew. "Why should I be Jack? I\'m Merridew."
    Ralph turned to him quickly. This was the voice of one who knew his own mind.
    "Then," went on Piggy, "that boy I forget "
    "You\'re talking too much," said Jack Merridew. "Shut up, Fatty."
    Laughter arose.
    "He\'s not Fatty," cried Ralph, "his real name\'s Piggy!"
    "Piggy!"
    "Piggy!"
    "Oh, Piggy!"
    A storm of laughter arose and even the tiniest child joined in. For the moment the boys
    were a closed circuit of sympathy with Piggy outside: he went very pink, bowed his head and
    cleaned his glasses again.
    Finally the laughter died away and the naming continued. There was Maurice, next in
    size among the choir boys to Jack, but broad and grinning all the time. There was a slight,
    furtive boy whom no one knew, who kept to himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and
    secrecy. He muttered that his name was Roger and was silent again. Bill, Robert, Harold,
    Henry; the choir boy who had fainted sat up against a palm trunk, smiled pallidly at Ralph and
    said that his name was Simon.
    Jack spoke.
    "We\'ve got to decide about being rescued."
    There was a buzz. One of the small boys, Henry, said that he wanted to go home.
    "Shut up," said Ralph absently. He lifted the conch. "Seems to me we ought to have a
    chief to decide things."
    "A chief! A chief!"
    "I ought to be chief," said Jack with simple arrogance, "because I\'m chapter chorister
    and head boy. I can sing C sharp."
    Another buzz.
    "Well then," said Jack, "I "
    He hesitated. The dark boy, Roger, stirred at last and spoke up.
    "Let\'s have a vote."
    "Yes!"
    "Vote for chief!"
    "Let\'s vote "
    This toy of voting was almost as pleasing as the conch. Jack started to protest but the
    clamor changed from the general wish for a chief to an election by acclaim of Ralph himself.
    None of the boys could have found good reason for this; what intelligence had been shown
    was traceable to Piggy while the most obvious leader was Jack. But there was a stillness about
    Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size, and attractive appearance; and most
    obscurely, yet most powerfully, there was the conch. The being that had blown that, had sat
    waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees, was set apart.
    "Him with the shell."
    "Ralph! Ralph!"
    "Let him be chief with the trumpet-thing."
    Ralph raised a hand for silence.
    "All right. Who wants Jack for chief?"
    With dreary obedience the choir raised their hands.
    "Who wants me?"
    Every hand outside the choir except Piggy\'s was raised immediately. Then Piggy, too,
    raised his hand grudgingly into the air.
    Ralph counted.
    "I\'m chief then."
    The circle of boys broke into applause. Even the choir applauded; and the freckles on
    Jack\'s face disappeared under a blush of mortification. He started up, then changed his mind
    and sat down again while the air rang. Ralph looked at him, eager to offer something.
    "The choir belongs to you, of course."
    "They could be the army "
    "Or hunters "
    "They could be "
    The suffusion drained away from Jack\'s face. Ralph waved again for silence.
    "Jack\'s in charge of the choir. They can be what do you want them to be?"
    "Hunters."
    Jack and Ralph smiled at each other with shy liking. The rest began to talk eagerly.
    Jack stood up.
    "All right, choir. Take off your togs."
    As if released from class, the choir boys stood up, chattered, piled their black cloaks on
    the grass. Jack laid his on the trunk by Ralph. His grey shorts were sticking to him with sweat.
    Ralph glanced at them admiringly, and when Jack saw his glance he explained.
    "I tried to get over that hill to see if there was water all round. But your shell called us."
    Ralph smiled and held up the conch for silence.
    "Listen, everybody. I\'ve got to have time to think things out. I can\'t decide what to do
    straight off. If this isn\'t an island we might be rescued straight away. So we\'ve got to decide if
    this is an island. Everybody must stay round here and wait and not go away. Three of us if we
    take more we\'d get all mixed, and lose each other three of us will go on an expedition and find
    out. I\'ll go, and Jack, and, and . . ."
    He looked round the circle of eager faces. There was no lack of boys to choose from.
    "And Simon."
    The boys round Simon giggled, and he stood up, laughing a little. Now that the pallor
    of his faint was over, he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a
    hut of straight hair that hung down, black and coarse.
    He nodded at Ralph.
    "I\'ll come."
    "And I "
    Jack snatched from behind him a sizable sheath-knife and clouted it into a trunk. The
    buzz rose and died away.
    Piggy stirred.
    "I\'ll come."
    Ralph turned to him.
    "You\'re no good on a job like this."
    "All the same "
    "We don\'t want you," said Jack, flatly. "Three\'s enough."
    Piggy\'s glasses flashed.
    "I was with him when he found the conch. I was with him before anyone else was."
    Jack and the others paid no attention. There was a general dispersal. Ralph, Jack and
    Simon jumped off the platform and walked along the sand past the bathing pool. Piggy hung
    bumbling behind them.
    "If Simon walks in the middle of us," said Ralph, "then we could talk over his head."
    The three of them fell into step. This meant that every now and then Simon had to do
    a double shuffle to catch up with the others. Presently Ralph stopped and turned back to
    Piggy.
    "Look."
    Jack and Simon pretended to notice nothing. They walked on.
    "You can\'t come."
    Piggy\'s glasses were misted again this time with humiliation.
    "You told \'em. After what I said."
    His face flushed, his mouth trembled.
    "After I said I didn\'t want "
    "What on earth are you talking about?"
    "About being called Piggy. I said I didn\'t care as long as they didn\'t call me Piggy; an\' I
    said not to tell and then you went an\' said straight out "
    Stillness descended on them. Ralph, looking with more understanding at Piggy, saw
    that he was hurt and crushed. He hovered between the two courses of apology or further
    insult.
    "Better Piggy than Fatty," he said at last, with the directness of genuine leadership,
    "and anyway, I\'m sorry if you feel like that. Now go back, Piggy, and take names. That\'s your
    job. So long."
    He turned and raced after the other two. Piggy stood and the rose of indignation faded
    slowly from his cheeks. He went back to the platform.
    The three boys walked briskly on the sand. The tide was low and there was a strip of
    weed-strewn beach that was almost as firm as a road. A kind of glamour was spread over them
    and the scene and they were conscious of the glamour and made happy by it. They turned to
    each other, laughing excitedly, talking, not listening. The air was bright. Ralph, faced by the
    task of translating all this into an explanation, stood on his head and fell over. When they had
    done laughing, Simon stroked Ralph\'s arm shyly; and they had to laugh again.
    "Come on," said Jack presently, "we\'re explorers."
    "We\'ll go to the end of the island," said Ralph, "and look round the corner."
    "If it is an island "
    Now, toward the end of the afternoon, the mirages were settling a little. They found
    the end of the island, quite distinct, and not magicked out of shape or sense. There was a
    jumble of the usual squareness, with one great block sitting out in the lagoon. Sea birds were
    nesting there.
    "Like icing," said Ralph, "on a pink cake."
    "We shan\'t see round this corner," said Jack, "because there isn\'t one. Only a slow
    curve and you can see, the rocks get worse "
    Ralph shaded his eyes and followed the jagged outline of the crags up toward the
    mountain. This part of the beach was nearer the mountain than any other that they had seen.
    "We\'ll try climbing the mountain from here," he said. "I should think this is the easiest
    way. There\'s less of that jungly stuff; and more pink rock. Come on."
    The three boys began to scramble up. Some unknown force had wrenched and
    shattered these cubes so that they lay askew, often piled diminishingly on each other. The
    most usual feature of the rock was a pink cliff surmounted by a skewed block; and that again
    surmounted, and that again, till the pinkness became a stack of balanced rock projecting
    through the looped fantasy of the forest creepers. Where the pink cliffs rose out of the ground
    there were often narrow tracks winding upwards. They could edge along them, deep in the
    plant world, their faces to the rock.
    "What made this track?"
    Jack paused, wiping the sweat from his face. Ralph stood by him, breathless.
    "Men?"
    Jack shook his head.
    "Animals."
    Ralph peered into the darkness under the trees. The forest minutely vibrated.
    "Come on."
    The difficulty was not the steep ascent round the shoulders of rock, but the occasional
    plunges through the undergrowth to get to the next path. Here the roots and stems of
    creepers were in such tangles that the boys had to thread through them like pliant needles.
    Their only guide, apart from the brown ground and occasional flashes of light through the
    foliage, was the tendency of slope: whether this hole, laced as it was with the cables of creeper,
    stood higher than that.
    Somehow, they moved up.
    Immured in these tangles, at perhaps their most difficult moment, Ralph turned with
    shining eyes to the others.
    "Wacco."
    "Wizard."
    "Smashing."
    The cause of their pleasure was not obvious. All three were hot, dirty and exhausted.
    Ralph was badly scratched. The creepers were as thick as their thighs and left little but tunnels
    for further penetration. Ralph shouted experimentally and they listened to the muted echoes.
    "This is real exploring," said Jack. "I bet nobody\'s been here before."
    "We ought to draw a map," said Ralph, "only we haven\'t any paper."
    "We could make scratches on bark," said Simon, "and rub black stuff in."
    Again came the solemn communion of shining eyes in the gloom.
    "Wacco."
    "Wizard."
    There was no place for standing on one\'s head. This time Ralph expressed the intensity
    of his emotion by pretending to knock Simon down; and soon they were a happy, heaving pile
    in the under-dusk.
    When they had fallen apart Ralph spoke first.
    "Got to get on."
    The pink granite of the next cliff was further back from the creepers and trees so that
    they could trot up the path. This again led into more open forest so that they had a glimpse of
    the spread sea. With openness came the sun; it dried the sweat that had soaked their clothes
    in the dark, damp heat. At last the way to the top looked like a scramble over pink rock, with
    no more plunging through darkness. The boys chose their way through defiles and over heaps
    of sharp stone.
    "Look! Look!"
    High over this end of the island, the shattered rocks lifted up their stacks and
    chimneys. This one, against which Jack leaned, moved with a grating sound when they pushed.
    "Come on."
    But not "Come on" to the top. The assault on the summit must wait while the three
    boys accepted this challenge. The rock was as large as a small motor car.
    "Heave!"
    Sway back and forth, catch the rhythm.
    "Heave!"
    Increase the swing of the pendulum, increase, increase, come up and bear against that
    point of furthest balance.increase.increase.
    "Heave!"
    The great rock loitered, poised on one toe, decided not to return, moved through the
    air, fell, struck, turned over, leapt droning through the air and smashed a deep hole in the
    canopy of the forest. Echoes and birds flew, white and pink dust floated, the forest further
    down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster: and then the island was still.
    "Wacco!"
    "Like a bomb!"
    "Whee-aa-oo!"
    Not for five minutes could they drag themselves away from this triumph. But they left
    at last.
    The way to the top was easy after that. As they reached the last stretch Ralph stopped.
    "Golly!"
    They were on the lip of a circular hollow in the side of the mountain. This was filled
    with a blue flower, a rock plant of some sort, and the overflow hung down the vent and spilled
    lavishly among the canopy of the forest. The air was thick with butterflies, lifting, fluttering,
    settling.
    Beyond the hollow was the square top of the mountain and soon they were standing on
    it.
    They had guessed before that this was an island: clambering among the pink rocks,
    with the sea on either side, and the crystal heights of air, they had known by some instinct
    that the sea lay on every side. But there seemed something more fitting in leaving the last
    word till they stood on the top, and could see a circular horizon of water.
    Ralph turned to the others.
    "This belongs to us."
    It was roughly boat-shaped: humped near this end with behind them the jumbled
    descent to the shore. On either side rocks, cliffs, treetops and a steep slope: forward there, the
    length of the boat, a tamer descent, tree-clad, with hints of pink: and then the jungly flat of
    the island, dense green, but drawn at the end to a pink tail. There, where the island petered
    out in water, was another island; a rock, almost detached, standing like a fort, facing them
    across the green with one bold, pink bastion.
    The boys surveyed all this, then looked out to sea. They were high up and the
    afternoon had advanced; the view was not robbed of sharpness by mirage.
    "That\'s a reef. A coral reef. I\'ve seen pictures like that."
    The reef enclosed more than one side of the island, lying perhaps a mile out and parallel
    to what they now thought of as their beach. The coral was scribbled in the sea as though a
    giant had bent down to reproduce the shape of the island in a flowing chalk line but tired
    before he had finished. Inside was peacock water, rocks and weeds showing as in an aquarium;
    outside was the dark blue of the sea. The tide was running so that long streaks of foam tailed
    away from the reef and for a moment they felt that the boat was moving steadily astern.
    Jack pointed down.
    "That\'s where we landed."
    Beyond falls and cliffs there was a gash visible in the trees; there were the splintered
    trunks and then the drag, leaving only a fringe of palm between the scar and the sea. There,
    too, jutting into the lagoon, was the platform, with insect-like figures moving near it.
    Ralph sketched a twining line from the bald spot on which they stood down a slope, a
    gully, through flowers, round and down to the rock where the scar started.
    "That\'s the quickest way back."
    Eyes shining, mouths open, triumphant, they savored the right of domination. They
    were lifted up: were friends.
    "There\'s no village smoke, and no boats," said Ralph wisely. "We\'ll make sure later; but
    I think it\'s uninhabited."
    "We\'ll get food," cried Jack. "Hunt. Catch things. until they fetch us."
    Simon looked at them both, saying nothing but nodding till his black hair flopped
    backwards and forwards: his face was glowing.
    Ralph looked down the other way where there was no reef.
    "Steeper," said Jack.
    Ralph made a cupping gesture.
    "That bit of forest down there . . . the mountain holds it up."
    Every point of the mountain held up trees flowers and trees. Now the forest stirred,
    roared, flailed. The nearer acres of rock flowers fluttered and for half a minute the breeze blew
    cool on their faces.
    Ralph spread his arms.
    "All ours."
    They laughed and tumbled and shouted on the mountain.
    "I\'m hungry."
    When Simon mentioned his hunger the others became aware of theirs.
    "Come on," said Ralph. "We\'ve found out what we wanted to know."
    They scrambled down a rock slope, dropped among flowers and made their way under
    the trees. Here they paused and examined the bushes round them curiously.
    Simon spoke first.
    "Like candles. Candle bushes. Candle buds."
    The bushes were dark evergreen and aromatic and the many buds were waxen green
    and folded up against the light. Jack slashed at one with his knife and the scent spilled over
    them.
    "Candle buds."
    "You couldn\'t light them," said Ralph. "They just look like candles."
    "Green candles," said Jack contemptuously. "We can\'t eat them. Come on."
    They were in the beginnings of the thick forest, plonking with weary feet on a track,
    when they heard the noises squeakings and the hard strike of hoofs on a path. As they
    pushed forward the squeaking increased till it became a frenzy. They found a piglet caught in a
    curtain of creepers, throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extreme terror. Its
    voice was thin, needle-sharp and insistent; The three boys rushed forward and Jack drew his
    knife again with a flourish. He raised his arm in the air. There came a pause, a hiatus, the pig
    continued to scream and the creepers to jerk, and the blade continued to flash at the end of a
    bony arm. The pause was only long enough for them to understand what an enormity the
    downward stroke would be. Then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and scurried into the
    undergrowth. They were left looking at each other and the place of terror. Jack\'s face was
    white under the freckles. He noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm
    down replacing the blade in the sheath. Then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to
    climb back to the track.
    "I was choosing a place," said Jack. "I was just waiting for a moment to decide where to
    stab him."
    "You should stick a pig," said Ralph fiercely. "They always talk about sticking a pig."
    "You cut a pig\'s throat to let the blood out," said Jack, "otherwise you can\'t eat the
    meat."
    "Why didn\'t you ?"
    They knew very well why he hadn\'t: because of the enormity of the knife descending
    and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood.
    "I was going to," said Jack. He was ahead of them, and they could not see his face. "I
    was choosing a place. Next time !"
    He snatched his knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk. Next time
    there would be no mercy. He looked round fiercely, daring them to contradict. Then they
    broke out into the sunlight and for a while they were busy finding and devouring food as they
        moved down the scar toward the platform and the meeting.</string>
    <string name="second_message">By the time Ralph finished blowing the conch the platform was crowded. There were
    differences between this meeting and the one held in the morning. The afternoon sun slanted
    in from the other side of the platform and most of the children, feeling too late the smart of
    sunburn, had put their clothes on. The choir, less of a group, had discarded their cloaks.
    Ralph sat on a fallen trunk, his left side to the sun. On his right were most of the choir;
    on his left the larger boys who had not known each other before the evacuation; before him
    small children squatted in the grass.
    Silence now. Ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his knees and a sudden breeze
    scattered light over the platform. He was uncertain whether to stand up or remain sitting. He
    looked sideways to his left, toward the bathing pool. Piggy was sitting near but giving no help.
    Ralph cleared his throat.
    "Well then."
    All at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to say. He passed a
    hand through his fair hair and spoke.
    "We're on an island. We've been on the mountain top and seen water all round. We
    saw no houses, no smoke, no footprints, no boats, no people. We're on an uninhabited island
    with no other people on it."
    Jack broke in.
    "All the same you need an army for hunting. Hunting pigs "
    "Yes. There are pigs on the island."
    All three of them tried to convey the sense of the pink live thing struggling in the
    creepers.
    "We saw "
    "Squealing "
    "It broke away "
    "Before I could kill it but next time!"
    Jack slammed his knife into a trunk and looked round challengingly.
    The meeting settled down again.
    "So you see," said Ralph, "We need hunters to get us meat. And another thing."
    He lifted the shell on his knees and looked round the sun-slashed faces.
    "There aren't any grownups. We shall have to look after ourselves."
    The meeting hummed and was silent.
    "And another thing. We can't have everybody talking at once. We'll have to have
    'Hands up' like at school."
    He held the conch before his face and glanced round the mouth.
    "Then I'll give him the conch."
    "Conch?"
    "That's what this shell's called. I'll give the conch to the next person to speak. He can
    hold it when he's speaking."
    "But "
    "Look "
    "And he won't be interrupted: Except by me."
    Jack was on his feet.
    "We'll have rules!" he cried excitedly. "Lots of rules! Then when anyone breaks 'em "
    "Whee oh!"
    "Wacco!"
    "Bong!"
    "Doink!"
    Ralph felt the conch lifted from his lap. Then Piggy was standing cradling the great
    cream shell and the shouting died down. Jack, left on his feet, looked uncertainly at Ralph who
    smiled and patted the log. Jack sat down. Piggy took off his glasses and blinked at the assembly
    while he wiped them on his shirt.
    "You're hindering Ralph. You're not letting him get to the most important thing."
    He paused effectively.
    "Who knows we're here? Eh?"
    "They knew at the airport."
    "The man with a trumpet-thing "
    "My dad."
    Piggy put on his glasses.
    "Nobody knows where we are," said Piggy. He was paler than before and breathless.
    "Perhaps they knew where we was going to; and perhaps not. But they don't know where we
    are 'cos we never got there." He gaped at them for a moment, then swayed and sat down.
    Ralph took the conch from his hands.
    "That's what I was going to say," he went on, "when you all, all. . . ." He gazed at their
    intent faces. "The plane was shot down in flames. Nobody knows where we are. We may be
    here a long time."
    The silence was so complete that they could hear the unevenness of Piggy\'s breathing.
    The sun slanted in and lay golden over half the platform. The breezes that on the lagoon had
    chased their tails like kittens were finding their way across the platform and into the forest.
    Ralph pushed back the tangle of fair hair that hung on his forehead.
    "So we may be here a long time."
    Nobody said anything. He grinned suddenly.
    "But this is a good island. We Jack, Simon and me  we climbed the mountain. It's
    wizard. There's food and drink, and "
    "Rocks "
    "Blue flowers "
    Piggy, partly recovered, pointed to the conch in Ralph\'s hands, and Jack and Simon fell
    silent. Ralph went on.
    "While we're waiting we can have a good time on this island."
    He gesticulated widely.
    "It's like in a book."
    At once there was a clamor.
    "Treasure Island "
    "Swallows and Amazons "
    "Coral Island "
    Ralph waved the conch.
    "This is our island. It's a good island. Until the grownups come to fetch us we'll have
    fun."
    Jack held out his hand for the conch.
    "There's pigs," he said. "There's food; and bathing water in that little stream along
    there and everything. Didn't anyone find anything else?"
    He handed the conch back to Ralph and sat down. Apparently no one had found
    anything.
    The older boys first noticed the child when he resisted. There was a group of little boys
    urging him forward and he did not want to go. He was a shrimp of a boy, about six years old,
    and one side of his face was blotted out by a mulberry-colored birthmark. He stood now,
    warped out of the perpendicular by the fierce light of publicity, and he bored into the coarse
    grass with one toe. He was muttering and about to cry.
    The other little boys, whispering but serious, pushed him toward Ralph.
    "All right," said Ralph, "come on then."
    The small boy looked round in panic.
    "Speak up!"
    The small boy held out his hands for the conch and the assembly shouted with
    laughter; at once he snatched back his hands and started to cry.
    "Let him have the conch!" shouted Piggy. "Let him have it!"
    At last Ralph induced him to hold the shell but by then the blow of laughter had taken
    away the child\'s voice. Piggy knelt by him, one hand on the great shell, listening and
    interpreting to the assembly.
    "He wants to know what you're going to do about the snake-thing."
    Ralph laughed, and the other boys laughed with him. The small boy twisted further
    into himself.
    "Tell us about the snake-thing."
    "Now he says it was a beastie."
    "Beastie?''
    "A snake-thing. Ever so big. He saw it."
    "Where?"
    "In the woods."
    Either the wandering breezes or perhaps the decline of the sun allowed a little coolness
    to lie under the trees. The boys felt it and stirred restlessly.
    "You couldn\'t have a beastie, a snake-thing, on an island this size," Ralph explained
    kindly. "You only get them in big countries, like Africa, or India."
    Murmur; and the grave nodding of heads.
    "He says the beastie came in the dark."
    "Then he couldn\'t see it!"
    Laughter and cheers.
    "Did you hear that? Says he saw the thing in the dark "
    "He still says he saw the beastie. It came and went away again an\' came back and
    wanted to eat him "
    "He was dreaming."
    Laughing, Ralph looked for confirmation round the ring of faces. The older boys
    agreed; but here and there among the little ones was the doubt that required more than
    rational assurance.
    "He must have had a nightmare. Stumbling about among all those creepers."
    More grave nodding; they knew about nightmares. "He says he saw the beastie, the
    snake-thing, and will it come back tonight?"
    "But there isn\'t a beastie!"
    "He says in the morning it turned into them things like ropes in the trees and hung in
    the branches. He says will it come back tonight?"
    "But there isn\'t a beastie!"
    There was no laughter at all now and more grave watching. Ralph pushed both hands
    through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed amusement and exasperation.
    Jack seized the conch.
    "Ralph\'s right of course. There isn\'t a snake-thing. But if there was a snake we\'d hunt it
    and kill it. We\'re going to hunt pigs to get meat for everybody. And we\'ll look for the snake
    too "
    "But there isn\'t a snake!"
    "We\'ll make sure when we go hunting."
    Ralph was annoyed and, for the moment, defeated. He felt himself facing something
    ungraspable. The eyes that looked so intently at him were without humor.
    "But there isn\'t a beast!"
    Something he had not known was there rose in him and compelled him to make the
    point, loudly and again.
    "But I tell you there isn\'t a beast!"
    The assembly was silent.
    Ralph lifted the conch again and his good humor came back as he thought of what he
    had to say next.
    "Now we come to the most important thing. I\'ve been thinking. I was thinking while
    we were climbing the mountain." He flashed a conspiratorial grin at the other two. "And on
    the beach just now. This is what I thought. We want to have fun. And we want to be rescued."
    The passionate noise of agreement from the assembly hit him like a wave and he lost
    his thread. He thought again.
    "We want to be rescued; and of course we shall be rescued."
    Voices babbled. The simple statement, unbacked by any proof but the weight of
    Ralph\'s new authority, brought light and happiness. He had to wave the conch before he could
    make them hear him.
    "My father\'s in the Navy. He said there aren\'t any unknown islands left. He says the
    Queen has a big room full of maps and all the islands in the world are drawn there. So the
    Queen\'s got a picture of this island."
    Again came the sounds of cheerfulness and better heart.
    "And sooner or later a ship will put in here. It might even be Daddy\'s ship. So you see,
    sooner or later, we shall be rescued."
    He paused, with the point made. The assembly was lifted toward safety by his words.
    They liked and now respected him. Spontaneously they began to clap and presently the
    platform was loud with applause. Ralph flushed, looking sideways at Piggy\'s open admiration,
    and then the other way at Jack who was smirking and showing that he too knew how to clap.
    Ralph waved the conch.
    "Shut up! Wait! Listen!"
    He went on in the silence, borne on his triumph.
    "There\'s another thing. We can help them to find us. If a ship comes near the island
    they may not notice us. So we must make smoke on top of the mountain. We must make a
    fire."
    "A fire! Make a fire!"
    At once half the boys were on their feet. Jack clamored among them, the conch
    forgotten.
    "Come on! Follow me!"
    The space under the palm trees was full of noise and movement. Ralph was on his feet
    too, shouting for quiet, but no one heard him. All at once the crowd swayed toward the island
    and was gone following Jack. Even the tiny children went and did their best among the leaves
    and broken branches. Ralph was left, holding the conch, with no one but Piggy.
    Piggy's breathing was quite restored.
    "Like kids!" he said scornfully. "Acting like a crowd of kids!"
    Ralph looked at him doubtfully and laid the conch on the tree trunk.
    "I bet it\'s gone tea-time," said Piggy. "What do they think they\'re going to do on that
    mountain?"
    He caressed the shell respectfully, then stopped and looked up.
    "Ralph! Hey! Where you going?"
    Ralph was already clambering over the first smashed swathes of the scar. A long way
    ahead of him was crashing and laughter.
    Piggy watched him in disgust.
    "Like a crowd of kids "
    He sighed, bent, and laced up his shoes. The noise of the errant assembly faded up the
    mountain. Then, with the martyred expression of a parent who has to keep up with the
    senseless ebullience of the children, he picked up the conch, turned toward the forest, and
    began to pick his way over the tumbled scar.
    Below the other side of the mountain top was a platform of forest. Once more Ralph
    found himself making the cupping gesture.
    "Down there we could get as much wood as we want."
    Jack nodded and pulled at his underlip. Starting perhaps a hundred feet below them on
    the steeper side of the mountain, the patch might have been designed expressly for fuel. Trees,
    forced by the damp heat, found too little soil for full growth, fell early and decayed: creepers
    cradled them, and new saplings searched a way up.
    Jack turned to the choir, who stood ready. Their black caps of maintenance were slid
    over one ear like berets.
    "We\'ll build a pile. Come on."
    They found the likeliest path down and began tugging at the dead wood. And the small
    boys who had reached the top came sliding too till everyone but Piggy was busy. Most of the
    wood was so rotten that when they pulled, it broke up into a shower of fragments and
    woodlice and decay; but some trunks came out in one piece. The twins, Sam 'n Eric, were the
    first to get a likely log but they could do nothing till Ralph, Jack, Simon, Roger and Maurice
    found room for a hand-hold. Then they inched the grotesque dead thing up the rock and
    toppled it over on top. Each party of boys added a quota, less or more, and the pile grew. At
    the return Ralph found himself alone on a limb with Jack and they grinned at each other,
    sharing this burden. Once more, amid the breeze, the shouting, the slanting sunlight on the
    high mountain, was shed that glamour, that strange invisible light of friendship, adventure, and
    content.
    "Almost too heavy."
    Jack grinned back.
    "Not for the two of us."
    Together, joined in an effort by the burden, they staggered up the last steep Of the
    mountain. Together, they chanted One! Two! Three! and crashed the log on to the great pile.
    Then they stepped back, laughing with triumphant pleasure, so that immediately Ralph had to
    stand on his head. Below them, boys were still laboring, though some of the small ones had
    lost interest and were searching this new forest for fruit. Now the twins, with unsuspected
    intelligence, came up the mountain with armfuls of dried leaves and dumped them against the
    pile. One by one, as they sensed that the pile was complete, the boys stopped going back for
    more and stood, with the pink, shattered top of the mountain around them. Breath came
    evenly by now, and sweat dried.
    Ralph and Jack looked at each other while society paused about them. The shameful
    knowledge grew in them and they did not know how to begin confession.
    Ralph spoke first, crimson in the face.
    "Will you?"
    He cleared his throat and went on.
    "Will you light the fire?"
    Now the absurd situation was open, Jack blushed too. He began to mutter vaguely.
    "You rub two sticks. You rub "
    He glanced at Ralph, who blurted out the last confession of incompetence.
    "Has anyone got any matches?"
    "You make a bow and spin the arrow," said Roger. He rubbed his hands in mime. "Psss.
    Psss."
    A little air was moving over the mountain. Piggy came with it, in shorts and shirt,
    laboring cautiously out of the forest with the evening sunlight gleaming from his glasses. He
    held the conch under his arm.
    Ralph shouted at him.
    "Piggy! Have you got any matches?"
    The other boys took up the cry till the mountain rang. Piggy shook his head and came
    to the pile.
    "My! You've made a big heap, haven't you?"
    Jack pointed suddenly.
    "His specs use them as burning glasses!"
    Piggy was surrounded before he could back away.
    "Here let me go!" His voice rose to a shriek of terror as Jack snatched the glasses off
    his face. "Mind out! Give 'em back! I can hardly see! You'll break the conch!"
    Ralph elbowed him to ne side and knelt by the pile.
    "Stand out of the light."
    There was pushing and pulling and officious cries. Ralph moved the lenses back and
    forth, this way and that, till a glossy white image of the declining sun lay on a piece of rotten
    wood. Almost at once a thin trickle of smoke rose up and made him cough. Jack knelt too and
    blew gently, so that the smoke drifted away, thickening, and a tiny flame appeared. The flame,
    nearly invisible at first in that bright sunlight, enveloped a small twig, grew, was enriched with
    color and reached up to a branch which exploded with a sharp crack. The flame flapped higher
    and the boys broke into a cheer.
    "My specs!" howled Piggy. "Give me my specs!"
    Ralph stood away from the pile and put the glasses into Piggy's groping hands. His
    voice subsided to a mutter.
    "Jus' blurs, that's all. Hardly see my hand "
    The boys were dancing. The pile was so rotten, and now so tinder-dry, that whole limbs
    yielded passionately to the yellow flames that poured upwards and shook a great beard of
    flame twenty feet in the air. For yards round the fire the heat was like a blow, and the breeze
    was a river of sparks. Trunks crumbled to white dust.
    Ralph shouted.
    "More wood! All of you get more wood!"
    Life became a race with the fire and the boys scattered through the upper forest. To
    keep a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the immediate end and no one looked
    further. Even the smallest boys, unless fruit claimed them, brought little pieces of wood and
    threw them in. The air moved a little faster and became a light wind, so that leeward and
    windward side were clearly differentiated. On one side the air was cool, but on the other the
    fire thrust out a savage arm of heat that crinkled hair on the instant. Boys who felt the evening
    wind on their damp faces paused to enjoy the freshness of it and then found they were
    exhausted. They flung themselves down in the shadows that lay among the shattered rocks.
    The beard of flame diminished quickly; then the pile fell inwards with a soft, cindery sound,
    and sent a great tree of sparks upwards that leaned away and drifted downwind. The boys lay,
    panting like dogs.
    Ralph raised his head off his forearms.
    "That was no good."
    Roger spat efficiently into the hot dust.
    "What d'you mean?"
    "There wasn't any smoke. Only flame."
    Piggy had settled himself in a space between two rocks, and sat with the conch on his
    knees.
    "We haven't made a fire," he said, "what's any use. We couldn't keep a fire like that
    going, not if we tried."
    "A fat lot you tried," said Jack contemptuously. "You just sat."
    "We used his specs," said Simon, smearing a black cheek with his forearm. "He helped
    that way."
    "I got the conch," said Piggy indignantly. "You let me speak!"
    "The conch doesn't count on top of the mountain," said Jack, "so you shut up."
    "I got the conch in my hand."
    "Put on green branches," said Maurice. "That's the best way to make smoke."
    "I got the conch "
    Jack turned fiercely.
    "You shut up!"
    Piggy wilted. Ralph took the conch from him and looked round the circle of boys.
    "We've got to have special people for looking after the fire. Any day there may be a
    ship out there" he waved his arm at the taut wire of the horizon "and if we have a signal
    going they'll come and take us off. And another thing. We ought to have more rules. Where
    the conch is, that's a meeting. The same up here as down there."
    They assented. Piggy opened his mouth to speak, caught Jack's eye and shut it again.
    Jack held out his hands for the conch and stood up, holding the delicate thing carefully in his
    sooty hands.
    "I agree with Ralph. We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not
    savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything. So we've got to do the right
    things."
    He turned to Ralph.
    "Ralph, I'll split up the choir my hunters, that is into groups, and we'll be responsible
    for keeping the fire going "
    This generosity brought a spatter of applause from the boys, so that Jack grinned at
    them, then waved the conch for silence.
    "We'll let the fire burn out now. Who would see smoke at night-time, anyway? And we
    can start the fire again whenever we like. Altos, you can keep the fire going this week, and
    trebles the next "
    The assembly assented gravely.
    "And we'll be responsible for keeping a lookout too. If we see a ship out there" they
    followed the direction of his bony arm with their eyes "we'll put green branches on. Then
    there'll be more smoke."
    They gazed intently at the dense blue of the horizon, as if a little silhouette might
    appear there at any moment.
    The sun in the west was a drop of burning gold that slid nearer and nearer the sill of the
    world. All at once they were aware of the evening as the end of light and warmth.
    Roger took the conch and looked round at them gloomily.
    "I've been watching the sea. There hasn't been the trace of a ship. Perhaps we'll never
    be rescued."
    A murmur rose and swept away. Ralph took back the conch.
    "I said before we'll be rescued sometime. We've just got to wait, that's all."
    Daring, indignant, Piggy took the conch.
    "That's what I said! I said about our meetings and things and then you said shut up "
    His voice lifted into the whine of virtuous recrimination. They stirred and began to
    shout him down.
    "You said you wanted a small fire and you been and built a pile like a hayrick. If I say
    anything," cried Piggy, with bitter realism, "you say shut up; but if Jack or Maurice or Simon "
    He paused in the tumult, standing, looking beyond them and down the unfriendly side
    of the mountain to the great patch where they had found dead wood. Then he laughed so
    strangely that they were hushed, looking at the flash of his spectacles in astonishment. They
    followed his gaze to find the sour joke.
    "You got your small fire all right."
    Smoke was rising here and there among the creepers that festooned the dead or dying
    trees. As they watched, a flash of fire appeared at the root of one wisp, and then the smoke
    thickened. Small flames stirred at the trunk of a tree and crawled away through leaves and
    brushwood, dividing and increasing. One patch touched a tree trunk and scrambled up like a
    bright squirrel. The smoke increased, sifted, rolled outwards. The squirrel leapt on the wings
    of the wind and clung to another standing tree, eating downwards. Beneath the dark canopy of
    leaves and smoke the fire laid hold on the forest and began to gnaw. Acres of black and yellow
    smoke rolled steadily toward the sea. At the sight of the flames and the irresistible course of
    the fire, the boys broke into shrill, excited cheering. The flames, as though they were a kind of
    wild life, crept as a jaguar creeps on its belly toward a line of birch-like saplings that fledged an
    outcrop of the pink rock. They flapped at the first of the trees, and the branches grew a brief
    foliage of fire. The heart of flame leapt nimbly across the gap between the trees and then went
    swinging and flaring along the whole row of them. Beneath the capering boys a quarter of a
    mile square of forest was savage with smoke and flame. The separate noises of the fire merged
    into a drum-roll that seemed to shake the mountain.
    "You got your small fire all right."
    Startled, Ralph realized that the boys were falling still and silent, feeling the beginnings
    of awe at the power set free below them. The knowledge and the awe made him savage.
    "Oh, shut up!"
    "I got the conch," said Piggy, in a hurt voice. "I got a right to speak."
    They looked at him with eyes that lacked interest in what they saw, and cocked ears at
    the drum-roll of the fire. Piggy glanced nervously into hell and cradled the conch.
    "We got to let that burn out now. And that was our firewood."
    He licked his lips.
    "There ain't nothing we can do. We ought to be more careful. I'm scared "
    Jack dragged his eyes away from the fire.
    "You're always scared. Yah Fatty!"
    "I got the conch," said Piggy bleakly. He turned to Ralph. "I got the conch, ain't I
    Ralph?"
    Unwillingly Ralph turned away from the splendid, awful sight.
    "What's that?"
    "The conch. I got a right to speak."
    The twins giggled together.
    "We wanted smoke "
    "Now look !"
    A pall stretched for miles away from the island. All the boys except Piggy started to
    giggle; presently they were shrieking with laughter.
    Piggy lost his temper.
    "I got the conch! Just you listen! The first thing we ought to have made was shelters
    down there by the beach. It wasn't half cold down there in the night. But the first time Ralph
    says 'fire' you goes howling and screaming up this here mountain. Like a pack of kids!"
    By now they were listening to the tirade.
    "How can you expect to be rescued if you don't put first things first and act proper?"
    He took off his glasses and made as if to put down the conch; but the sudden motion
    toward it of most of the older boys changed his mind. He tucked the shell under his arm, and
    crouched back on a rock.
    "Then when you get here you build a bonfire that isn't no use. Now you been and set
    the whole island on fire. Won't we look funny if the whole island burns up? Cooked fruit,
    that's what we'll have to eat, and roast pork. And that's nothing to laugh at! You said Ralph
    was chief and you don't give him time to think. Then when he says something you rush off,
    like, like "
    He paused for breath, and the fire growled at them.
    "And that's not all. Them kids. The little 'uns. Who took any notice of 'em? Who
    knows how many we got?"
    Ralph took a sudden step forward.
    "I told you to. I told you to get a list of names!"
    "How could I," cried Piggy indignantly, "all by myself? They waited for two minutes,
    then they fell in the sea; they went into the forest; they just scattered everywhere. How was I
    to know which was which?"
    Ralph licked pale lips.
    "Then you don't know how many of us there ought to be?"
    "How could I with them little 'uns running round like insects? Then when you three
    came back, as soon as you said make a fire, they all ran away, and I never had a chance "
    "That's enough!" said Ralph sharply, and snatched back the conch. "If you didn't you
    didn't."
    " then you come up here an' pinch my specs "
    Jack turned on him.
    "You shut up!"
    " and them little 'uns was wandering about down there where the fire is. How d'you
    know they aren't still there?"
    Piggy stood up and pointed to the smoke and flames. A murmur rose among the boys
    and died away. Something strange was happening to Piggy, for he was gasping for breath.
    "That little 'un " gasped Piggy "him with the mark on his face, I don't see him.
    Where is he now?"
    The crowd was as silent as death.
    "Him that talked about the snakes. He was down there "
    A tree exploded in the fire like a bomb. Tall swathes of creepers rose for a moment
    into view, agonized, and went down again. The little boys screamed at them.
    "Snakes! Snakes! Look at the snakes!"
    In the west, and unheeded, the sun lay only an inch or two above the sea. Their faces
    were lit redly from beneath. Piggy fell against a rock and clutched it with both hands.
    "That little 'un that had a mark on his face where is he now? I tell you I don't see
    him."
    The boys looked at each other fearfully, unbelieving.
    " where is he now?"
    Ralph muttered the reply as if in shame. "Perhaps he went back to the, the " Beneath
        them, on the unfriendly side of the mountain, the drum-roll continued.</string>
    <string name="third_message">Jack was bent double. He was down like a sprinter, his nose only a few inches from the
    humid earth. The tree trunks and the creepers that festooned them lost themlves in a green
    dusk thirty feet above him, and all about was the undergrowth. There was only the faintest
    indication of a trail here; a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of a
    hoof. He lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would force them to speak to
    him. Then dog-like, uncomfortably on all fours yet unheeding his discomfort, he stole forward
    five yards and stopped. Here was loop of creeper with a tendril pendant from a node. The
    tendril was polished on the underside; pigs, passing through the loop, brushed it with their
    bristly hide.
    Jack crouched with his face a few inches away from this clue, then stared forward into
    the semi-darkness of the undergrowth. His sandy hair, considerably longer than it had been
    when they dropped in, was lighter now; and his bare back was a mass of dark freckles and
    peeling sunburn. A sharpened stick about five feet long trailed from his right hand, and except
    for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knife-belt he was naked. He closed his eyes, raised
    his head and breathed in gently with flared nostrils, assessing the current of warm air for
    information. The forest and he were very still.
    At length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes. They were bright
    blue, eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad. He passed his tongue across
    dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest. Then again he stole forward and cast this
    way and that over the ground.
    The silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat, and at this hour of the day
    there was not even the whine of insects. Only when Jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a
    primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that
    seemed to come out of the abyss of ages. Jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn
    breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle
    of trees. Then the trail, the frustration, claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly.
    By the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked, closed his eyes,
    and once more drew in the warm air; and this time his breath came short, there was even a
    passing pallor in his face, and then the surge of blood again. He passed like a shadow under the
    darkness of the tree and crouched, looking down at the trodden ground at his feet.
    The droppings were warm. They lay piled among turned earth. They were olive green,
    smooth, and they steamed a little. Jack lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of
    creeper that lay across the trail. Then he raised his spear and sneaked forward. Beyond the
    creeper, the trail joined a pig-run that was wide enough and trodden enough to be a path. The
    ground was hardened by an accustomed tread and as Jack rose to his full height he heard
    something moving on it. He swung back his right arm and hurled the spear with all his
    strength. From the pig-run came the quick, hard patter of hoofs, a castanet sound, seductive,
    maddeningthe promise of meat. He rushed out of the undergrowth and snatched up his
    spear. The pattering of pig\'s trotters died away in the distance.
    Jack stood there, streaming with sweat, streaked with brown earth, stained by all the
    vicissitudes of a day\'s hunting. Swearing, he turned off the trail and pushed his way through
    until the forest opened a little and instead of bald trunks supporting a dark roof there were
    light grey trunks and crowns of feathery palm. Beyond these was the glitter of the sea and he
    could hear voices. Ralph was standing by a contraption of palm trunks and leaves, a rude
    shelter that faced the lagoon and seemed very near to falling down. He did not notice when
    Jack spoke.
    "Got any water?"
    Ralph looked up, frowning, from the complication of leaves. He did not notice Jack
    even when he saw him.
    "I said have you got any water? I\'m thirsty." Ralph withdrew his attention from the
    shelter and realized Jack with a start.
    "Oh, hullo. Water? There by the tree. Ought to be some left."
    Jack took up a coconut shell that brimmed with fresh water from among a group that
    was arranged in the shade, and drank. The water splashed over his chin and neck and chest.
    He breathed noisily when he had finished.
    "Needed that."
    Simon spoke from inside the shelter.
    "Up a bit."
    Ralph turned to the shelter and lifted a branch with a whole tiling of leaves.
    The leaves came apart and fluttered down. Simon\'s contrite face appeared in the hole.
    "Sorry."
    Ralph surveyed the wreck with distaste.
    "Never get it done."
    He flung himself down at Jack\'s feet. Simon remained, looking out of the hole in the
    shelter. Once down, Ralph explained.
    "Been working for days now. And look!"
    Two shelters were in position, but shaky. This one was a ruin.
    "And they keep running off. You remember the meeting? How everyone was going to
    work hard until the shelters were finished?"
    "Except me and my hunters"
    "Except the hunters. Well, the littluns are"
    He gesticulated, sought for a word.
    "They\'re hopeless. The older ones aren\'t much better. D\'you see? All day I\'ve been
    working with Simon. No one else. They\'re off bathing, or eating, or playing."
    Simon poked his head out carefully.
    "You\'re chief. You tell \'em off."
    Ralph lay flat and looked up at the palm trees and the sky.
    "Meetings. Don\'t we love meetings? Every day. Twice a day. We talk." He got on one
    elbow. "I bet if I blew the conch this minute, they\'d come running. Then we\'d be, you know,
    very solemn, and someone would say we ought to build a jet, or a submarine, or a TV set.
    When the meeting was over they\'d work for five minutes, then wander off or go hunting."
    Jack flushed.
    "We want meat."
    "Well, we haven\'t got any yet. And we want shelters. Besides, the rest of your hunters
    came back hours ago. They\'ve been swimming."
    "I went on," said Jack. "I let them go. I had to go on. I"
    He tried to convey the compulsion to track down and kill that was swallowing him up.
    "I went on. I thought, by myself"
    The madness came into his eyes again.
    "I thought I mightkill."
    "But you didn\'t."
    "I thought I might."
    Some hidden passion vibrated in Ralph\'s voice.
    "But you haven\'t yet."
    His invitation might have passed as casual, were it not for the undertone.
    "You wouldn\'t care to help with the shelters, I suppose?"
    "We want meat"
    "And we don\'t get it."
    Now the antagonism was audible.
    "But I shall! Next time! I\'ve got to get a barb on this spear! We wounded a pig and the
    spear fell out. If we could only make barbs"
    "We need shelters."
    Suddenly Jack shouted in rage.
    "Are you accusing?"
    "All I\'m saying is we\'ve worked dashed hard. That\'s all."
    They were both red in the face and found looking at each other difficult. Ralph rolled
    on his stomach and began to play with the grass.
    "If it rains like when we dropped in we\'ll need shelters all right. And then another
    thing. We need shelters because of the"
    He paused for a moment and they both pushed their anger away. Then he went on with
    the safe, changed subject.
    "You\'ve noticed, haven\'t you?"
    Jack put down his spear and squatted.
    "Noticed what?"
    "Well. They\'re frightened."
    He rolled over and peered into Jack\'s fierce, dirty face.
    "I mean the way things are. They dream. You can hear \'em. Have you been awake at
    night?"
    Jack shook his head.
    "They talk and scream. The littluns. Even some of the others. As if"
    "As if it wasn\'t a good island."
    Astonished at the interruption, they looked up at Simon\'s serious face.
    "As if," said Simon, "the beastie, the beastie or the snake-thing, was real. Remember?"
    The two older boys flinched when they heard the shameful syllable. Snakes were not
    mentioned now, were not mentionable.
    "As if this wasn\'t a good island," said Ralph slowly. "Yes, that\'s right."
    Jack sat up and stretched out his legs.
    "They\'re batty."
    "Crackers. Remember when we went exploring?" They grinned at each other,
    remembering the glamour of the first day. Ralph went on.
    "So we need shelters as a sort of"
    "Home."
    "That\'s right."
    Jack drew up his legs, clasped his knees, and frowned in an effort to attain clarity.
    "All the samein the forest. I mean when you\'re hunting, not when you\'re getting fruit,
    of course, but when you\'re on your own"
    He paused for a moment, not sure if Ralph would take him seriously.
    "Go on."
    "If you\'re hunting sometimes you catch yourself feeling as if" He flushed suddenly.
    "There\'s nothing in it of course. Just a feeling. But you can feel as if you\'re not hunting, but
    being hunted, as if something\'s behind you all the time in the jungle."
    They were silent again: Simon intent, Ralph incredulous and faintly indignant. He sat
    up, rubbing one shoulder with a dirty hand.
    "Well, I don\'t know."
    Jack leapt to his feet and spoke very quickly.
    "That\'s how you can feel in the forest. Of course there\'s nothing in it. Onlyonly"
    He took a few rapid steps toward the beach, then came back.
    "Only I know how they feel. See? That\'s all."
    "The best thing we can do is get ourselves rescued."
    Jack had to think for a moment before he could remember what rescue was.
    "Rescue? Yes, of course! All the same, I\'d like to catch a pig first" He snatched up his
    spear and dashed it into the ground. The opaque, mad look came into his eyes again. Ralph
    looked at him critically through his tangle of fair hair.
    "So long as your hunters remember the fire"
    "You and your fire!"
    The two boys trotted down the beach, and, turning at the water\'s edge, looked back at
    the pink mountain. The trickle of smoke sketched a chalky line up the solid blue of the sky,
    wavered high up and faded. Ralph frowned.
    "I wonder how far off you could see that."
    "Miles."
    "We don\'t make enough smoke."
    The bottom part of the trickle, as though conscious of their gaze, thickened to a
    creamy blur which crept up the feeble column.
    "They\'ve put on green branches," muttered Ralph. "I wonder!" He screwed up his eyes
    and swung round to search the horizon.
    "Got it!"
    Jack shouted so loudly that Ralph jumped.
    "What? Where? Is it a ship?"
    But Jack was pointing to the high declivities that led down from the mountain to the
    flatter part of the island.
    "Of course! They\'ll lie up therethey must, when the sun\'s too hot"
    Ralph gazed bewildered at his rapt face.
    "they get up high. High up and in the shade, resting during the heat, like cows at
    home"
    "I thought you saw a ship!"
    "We could steal up on onepaint our faces so they wouldn\'t seeperhaps surround
    them and then"
    Indignation took away Ralph\'s control.
    "I was talking about smoke! Don\'t you want to be rescued? All you can talk about is
    pig, pig, pig!"
    "But we want meat!"
    "And I work all day with nothing but Simon and you come back and don\'t even notice
    the huts!"
    "I was working too"
    "But you like it!" shouted Ralph. "You want to hunt! While I"
    They faced each other on the bright beach, astonished at the rub of feeling. Ralph
    looked away first, pretending interest in a group of littluns on the sand. From beyond the
    platform came the shouting of the hunters in the swimming pool. On the end of the platform,
    Piggy was lying flat, looking down into the brilliant water.
    "People don\'t help much."
    He wanted to explain how people were never quite what you thought they were.
    "Simon. He helps." He pointed at the shelters.
    "All the rest rushed off. He\'s done as much as I have. Only"
    "Simon\'s always about."
    Ralph stared back to the shelters with Jack by his side.
    "Do a bit for you," muttered Jack, "before I have a bathe."
    "Don\'t bother."
    But when they reached the shelters Simon was not to be seen. Ralph put his head in the
    hole, withdrew it, and turned to Jack.
    "He\'s buzzed off."
    "Got fed up," said Jack, "and gone for a bathe."
    Ralph frowned.
    "He\'s queer. He\'s funny."
    Jack nodded, as much for the sake of agreeing as anything, and by tacit consent they
    left the shelter and went toward the bathing pool.
    "And then," said Jack, "when I\'ve had a bathe and something to eat, I\'ll just trek over
    to the other side of the mountain and see if I can see any traces. Coming?"
    "But the sun\'s nearly set!"
    "I might have time-"
    They walked along, two continents of experience and feeling, unable to communicate.
    "If I could only get a pig!"
    "I\'ll come back and go on with the shelter."
    They looked at each other, baffled, in love and hate. All the warm salt water of the
    bathing pool and the shouting and splashing and laughing were only just sufficient to bring
    them together again.
    Simon was not in the bathing pool as they had expected.
    When the other two had trotted down the beach to look back at the mountain he had
    followed them for a few yards and then stopped. He had stood frowing down at a pile of sand
    on the beach where somebody had been trying to build a little house or hut. Then he turned
    his back on this and walked into the forest with an air of purpose. He was a small, skinny boy,
    his chin pointed, and his eyes so bright they had deceived Ralph into thinking him delightfully
    gay and wicked. The coarse mop of black hair was long and swung down, almost concealing a
    low, broad forehead. He wore the remains of shorts and his feet were bare like Jack\'s. Always
    darkish in color, Simon was burned by the sun to a deep tan that glistened with sweat.
    He picked his way up the scar, passed the great rock where Ralph had climbed on the
    first morning, then turned off to his right among the trees. He walked with an accustomed
    tread through the acres of fruit trees, where the least energetic could find an easy if
    unsatisfying meal. Flower and fruit grew together on the same tree and everywhere was the
    scent of ripeness and the booming of a million bees at pasture. Here the littluns who had run
    after him caught up with him. They talked, cried out unintelligibly, lugged him toward the
    trees. Then, amid the roar of bees in the afternoon sunlight, Simon found for them the fruit
    they could not reach, pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage, passed them back down to
    the endless, outstretched hands. When he had satisfied them he paused and looked round.
    The littluns watched him inscrutably over double handfuls of ripe fruit.
    Simon turned away from them and went where the just perceptible path led him. Soon
    high jungle closed in. Tall trunks bore unexpected pale flowers all the way up to the dark
    canopy where life went on clamorously. The air here was dark too, and the creepers dropped
    their ropes like the rigging of foundered ships. His feet left prints in the soft soil and the
    creepers shivered throughout their lengths when he bumped them.
    He came at last to a place where more sunshine fell. Since they had not so far to go for
    light the creepers had woven a great mat that hung at the side of an open space in the jungle;
    for here a patch of rock came close to the surface and would not allow more than little plants
    and ferns to grow. The whole space was walled with dark aromatic bushes, and was a bowl of
    heat and light. A great tree, fallen across one corner, leaned against the trees that still stood
    and a rapid climber flaunted red and yellow sprays right to the top.
    Simon paused. He looked over his shoulder as Jack had done at the close ways behind
    him and glanced swiftly round to confirm that he was utterly alone. For a moment his
    movements were almost furtive. Then he bent down and wormed his way into the center of
    the mat. The creepers and the bushes were so close that he left his sweat on them and they
    pulled together behind him. When he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin
    screened off from the open space by a few leaves. He squatted down, parted the leaves and
    looked out into the clearing. Nothing moved but a pair of gaudy butterflies that danced round
    each other in the hot air. Holding his breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the
    island. Evening was advancing toward the island; the sounds of the bright fantastic birds, the
    bee-sounds, even the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts among the square
    rocks, were fainter. The deep sea breaking miles away on the reef made an undertone less
    perceptible than the susurration of the blood.
    Simon dropped the screen of leaves back into place. The slope of the bars of honeycolored
    sunlight decreased; they slid up the bushes, passed over the green candle-like buds,
    moved up toward the canopy, and darkness thickened under the trees. With the fading of the
    light the riotous colors died and the heat and urgency cooled away. The candlebuds stirred.
    Their green sepals drew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose delicately to meet
    the open air.
    Now the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from the sky.
    Darkness poured out, submerging the ways between the trees till they were dim and strange as
    the bottom of the sea. The candle-buds opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the
    light that pricked down from the first stars. Their scent spilled out into the air and took
        possession of the island.</string>
